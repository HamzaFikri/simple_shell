.SH DESCRIPTION
 The \fB\ bsh \fR (Simple Shell) is a simple UNIX command line interpreter (ALX Holberton School Project 0x16-Simple_Shell)

.SH Overview
A shell is a command-line interpreter that executes commands read from a terminal.\
BlueShell is a basic implementation of a command line similar to
.B bash
or
.B dash.
.B Simple Shell
can be used in both interactive and non-interactive mode.
The user input line is vectorized, each token is separated by spaces.\
The first argument at tokens[0] is understood by the shell to be a command.\
The shell will first match the command token against a list of built-in programs,\
then the program will check the $PATH and run that command if it can be found.\
Remaining tokens are argument tokens and are treated as modifiers or options.

.TP
.B -cd
